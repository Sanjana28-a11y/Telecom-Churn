# Telecom-Churn
This project predicts whether a telecom customer will leave using machine learning. The data is cleaned, visualized, and processed before training a Decision Tree Classifier for predictions.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Visualization of trends in customer behavior
- Balancing data using RandomOverSampler
- Training a Decision Tree model for churn prediction
- Evaluating performance with accuracy and recall
